        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Should explicitly set android:allowBackup to true or false (it&apos;s true by default, and that can have some security implications for the application&apos;s data)"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application&apos;s manifest"
        explanation="The allowBackup attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`"

        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.

NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.

Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.
